This is our Pandas Challenge - a big weekend... Lots of time spent on this one.

Fun Fact for the week - A panda can poop 28kg per day!

99% of a panda's diet consists of bamboo, but its digestive tract retains carnivorous characteristics. Giant pandas' ability to digest bamboo is low at less than 20 percent, and bamboo itself is low in nutrients. So, in order to keep up their energy, pandas have to eat a lot of bamboo and thus poop a lot!

Giant pandas poop every 15–20 minutes. The vast majority of their feces is undigested bamboo.

In the past, locals made the undigested bamboo pieces in the poop into picture frames and bookmarks — remarkably they did not smell!
